# discordBot
Modular Discord bot, developed in JavaScript and based of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/)

# Download/Installation

## Windows
1. First of all, you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/es/) and [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/)
2. Second step is to install Discord.js in the working directory `npm install discord.js`
3. A .bat file is included in the folder, in order to start the bot easily. Anyway, feel free to launch the bot trought console
typing `nodemon bot.js`

*Note: nodemon is necessary to make the development work easier and allow the bot to restart once changes are made to the source 
code. Node.js can be used if preferable by the user*
